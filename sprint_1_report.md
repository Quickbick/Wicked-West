## What's New (User Facing)
 * Basic Character and Camera Controls
 * Open AI Chat GPT Integration
 * 3D outhouse model that players can walk into
 * 3D church model that players can walk into

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint, our team planned the development of our game, including the game components and requirements needed to develop it. In addition, this sprint was used to answer questions of "how" concepts for the game will be achieved. The OpenAI leaning model was decided on in this Sprint, in addition to making a 3d game in Unity, because the compatability between the two was tested in the Sprint and shown possible. Work was distributed in roles to team members based on what they have experience in, and this was used to overcome barriers when not everyone knew 3d Modeling or Storyboarding. Our team learned that scope is important to keep with a game, and that we can't add too many features too early before we have a functional base of a game.

## Unfinished Work
We accomplished most of what our team had planned to get done during this sprint, but there are still a few issues that our team was not able to close during this sprint due to having to dedicate more time to higher priority tasks or rasks taking longer than expected. Some issues that we did not complete were character portraits, a detailed storyboard, and the saloon 3D model. While there has been small progress on each of these issues, these issues remain open and will be completed during the next sprint. See the 'Incomplete User Stories' section below for detailed explanations on why these issues have not been closed.

 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:

  * https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/msft-aiassistedgamedev/issues/16 We did not get to this issue because we ran into complication with mapping materials to the church model and troubleshooting took longer thaan expected. 
 * https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/msft-aiassistedgamedev/issues/24
     We decided that there were other features of higher priority for this sprint, and the two members that need to meet up to work on this issue didn't have time to coordinate and finish this after other things of higher importance were completed.
 * https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/msft-aiassistedgamedev/issues/25 We decided to hold on character designs until we had finished the overall storyboard and had more detailed descriptions of the characters. 

## Code Files for Review
Please review the following code files, which were actively developed during this sprint, for quality:

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * The team has done well with communicating with each other about what they are working on. 
  * Each team member has their own expertise, and we've all been able to contribute in areas we are most passionate about.
  * Each team member has vocalized the tasks that they are interested in completing. 
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * We could possibly simplify the implementations we are making. 
   * We would like to improve our time management so that we are not overloading ourselves with tasks that we are not able to get done, while also making sure we complete all assigned issues. 
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Instead of getting caught up in the big picture, we will focus on what we want our game to look like after the next sprint. 
   * Completing all issues we assign to ourselves and being reasonable with the amount of tasks we assign ourselves.
