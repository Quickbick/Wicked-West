## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint our team worked on expanding the game space by adding more models, menus, UI elements, and other backend pieces required to make it all work. A large amount of time was put into the inventory system, including storing items in the database, creating 3D models and 2D images of items, and implementing a UI so that players can view items in their inventory. We also added a large amount of model assets to the game this sprint. We discovered a lot of complexity that comes with the integration of frameworks, APIs, and other premade materals, specifically Easy Save 3. We also further learned about the Unity engine and some of the various smaller issues that can come with working in it. We have started working on implementing chat GPT conversation with NPCs within the game environment. Lots of time was spent looking further into the OpenAI-connected Dialogue System which we integrated into our game during the last sprint. Currently, we are able to generate barks, a list of prompts generated by Chat GPT that the player can choose from when starting a conversation with an NPC. Further conversation will be developed in an upcoming sprint. 

## Unfinished Work
As we were wrapping up our work for this sprint, our team encountered some Git issues that came from Easy Save 3. Our team has been using Easy Save 3 to save player data which will allow players to save their game and resume it later. However, we discovered that it was causing merge conflicts with Git. Because of this, we had to troubleshoot to ensure that everyone was able to merge their changes to main before making any more updates to the main scene. The only update planned for this sprint that was not finished was open/close door functionality on all buildings. This implementation was put on pause while the team was resolvong their merge conflicts.

 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
 
 * https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-F23-S24/msft-aiassistedgamedev/issues/132 Fix all doors <<Our team ran into issues with Easy Save 3, whcih we were using to save player's progress in the game. These issues were causing continuous merge conflicts in Git. To avoid merge conflicts, we made sure the entire team was able to merge their updates to main before making any more changes to the main scene.>>

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Meeting deadlines that our team set for themselves each week 
  * Knowledge of what team members were working on 
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * More frequent pushes/pulls to avoid merge conflicts 
   * Communicating with the team when changes have been pushed to main
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Communicating with the team when changes have been pushed to main
   * Being more timely with merges so that the entire team is not merging their code at the same time
   * Exploring more git-friendly saving/loading framework options
